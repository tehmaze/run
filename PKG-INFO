         python-run
        ============
        
        This module provides convenient ways to guarantee a certain script
        state. 
        
        ``run.alone``
        =============
        
        Make sure only one instance of the program is running,
        this is done by acquiring an fcntl file lock on the
        current script:
        
            >>> import run.alone
        
        Caveats
        -------
        
        There are a few things to keep in mind:
        
        1. import run.alone once, it will exit your program if it gets
           imported twice
        
        2. symlinked scripts will be resolved to the inode it has been
           linked to, this is a limitiation of using fcltn file locks
        
        ``run.until``
        =============
        
        Run until a specified timespec, if the process runs
        longer, it will be killed:
        
            >>> import run
            >>> run.until('23m42s')
            >>> ...
        
        You can also choose to limit on the amount of CPU-time
        being consumed (default is wall clock time):
        
            >>> run.until('42s', 'cpu')
            >>> ...
